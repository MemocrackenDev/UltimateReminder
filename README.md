# Config.yml Help

Looking for help with setup? You are in the right place

- Enable or Disable

This option is created to enable or disable the pluing action

```
config:
  # true > Plugin Working / false > The plugin will not be working
  enable: true
```

- Prefix

This option is created to change the prefix of each ad, for example if the plugin gives 
the ad by default it will be like this:

**[UReminder] Memocracken its the best because its my creator!**

In the configuration you can change this method, this is an example:

**[DMC] Memocracken its the best because its my creator!**

```
config:
  prefix: "&f[&6UReminder&f] "
```

And if it were the second option it would be like this:

```
config:
  prefix: "&f[&DMC&f] "
```

and so on for any prefix you want.
